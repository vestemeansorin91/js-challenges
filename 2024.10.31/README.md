- yourArray[yourIndex]
- yourArray.slice()
- yourArray.splice()
- yourArray.push()
- yourArray.pop()
- yourArray.shift()
- yourArray.unshift()
- yourArray.find()
- yourArray.filter()
- yourArray.forEach()
- yourArray.every()
- yourArray.some()
- yourArray.sort()
- yourArray.join()

Objects https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object 
- Object.keys(yourObject)
- Object.values(yourObject)
- Object.entries(yourObject)

- delete yourObject[yourKey]

Dates (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

Type coercion / Type casting

Boolean -> Number
Boolean(yourNumber)

Number -> Boolean
Number(yourBoolean)

Number -> String
yourNumber.toString()

String -> Number
Number(yourString)

-------
Comparision

Two Arrays / Two Objects
JSON.stringify(yourArray1) === JSON.stringify(yourArray2) // This works only they are also sorted, also for Objects

Before Each Challenge
- START THE TIMER
- CREATE PULL REQUEST
- READ THE CHALLENGE / UNDERSTAND IT
- WRITE IT ON PAPER / DRAW / MAKE A PLAN / TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT A SOLUTION
- IMPLEMENT IT / WRITE CODE

During each challenge
